# Heart Disease Prediction with KNN Algorithm and PyQt5 GUI

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, to predict heart disease. The application is implemented in Python, with the predictive model trained on relevant medical data. Additionally, a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) is built using PyQt5, providing an interactive experience for users to input health parameters and receive predictions.

## Features
KNN Algorithm: Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for accurate heart disease prediction based on input features.

PyQt5 GUI: The application includes an intuitive GUI built with PyQt5, allowing users to easily input their health parameters and receive predictions.

Predictive Modeling: The machine learning model is trained on a dataset to make accurate predictions about the likelihood of heart disease based on input parameters.

User Feedback: Users receive clear and informative feedback on their heart disease prediction through the GUI.

## Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
PyQt5 (for GUI)
